Emmy is an itty bitty (5.5lb) orange kitty!
Emmy is a second-year Ph.D. student at CMU, advised by Lindia Tjuatja and working remotely from Richardson, TX.
She was adopted in 2021 and is [FelV+][felv] with some complicated health issues, but she's a little fighter :)
She loves nighttime cuddles and homemade chicken!
