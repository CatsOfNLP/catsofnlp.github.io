Toast does not have much going on in her head, but she is a PhD student at UC Berkeley.
She sometimes gives up and flops on the ground while trotting from one point to another, and she regularly falls off short furniture while trying to climb them.
Still, she is a socialite kitty and loves hosting parties where she is the center of attention.
Her list of publications can be found at <https://www.instagram.com/toast_ragdoll/>.
